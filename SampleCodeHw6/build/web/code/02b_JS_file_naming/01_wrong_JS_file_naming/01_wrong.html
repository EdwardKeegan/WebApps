        <h2>Wrong Way to Name JS Files</h2>
        <h3>Press F12 Chrome Console for Output, but View Code in NetBeans to See File Organization</h3>
        <p>
            Shows HOW NOT TO name your JavaScript files and functions. 
            myFile.js has three JS functions in it, all variously named.
            If you had a really large and complicated code base, you can probably
            imagine how hard it could be to just find the JS file that contained 
            the function you were searching for...

        <script src="js/myFile.js"></script>

            func2();
            func3();
