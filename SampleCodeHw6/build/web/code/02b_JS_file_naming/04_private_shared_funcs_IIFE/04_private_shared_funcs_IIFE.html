        <h2>How to Use an IIFE So Related Public Functions Can Share Private Functions</h2>

            This example shows how you can use an <strong>IIFE</strong> (pronounced IF-ee, stands for
            Immediately Invoking Function Expression) to group related public functions 
            that needed to share some private code. In your JS file, declare a public object and follow that 
            with an IIFE. In the IIFE, define the public functions as public methods 
            of the global object, then define the shared functions - the shared functions will be private and 
            accessible by the public methods also defined in the IIFE.
