            This code:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Still has no user interface (it just prints to the console log). 
            </li>
            <li>
                Makes two objects, each having some private properties and private methods. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Since the data members are private, you can't access them except through 
                public getter/setter functions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scroll down for discussion of JavaScript "closure".
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What is JavaScript Closure?</h4>
        <p>
            If you look at the MakeCar function through the eyes of a Java programmer, you might 
            ask "Why declare condition and price as local variables when these variables will 
            just be destroyed when the MakeCar function finishes running?" 
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript variables are not destroyed when the function that created them goes 
            out of scope. JavaScript variables (like Java Static variables) retain their values 
            even after the function that created them is "closed" -- I think this is why they 
            call it "JavaScript Closure". 
        </p>

            var yourCarObj = MakeCar("red BMW", "fair", 2500);
            yourCarObj.log();

            myCarObj.setCondition("poor");
            myCarObj.log();

            yourCarObj.changePrice(0.1); // 10% increase in price
            yourCarObj.log();

            console.log("trying to print private property condition:");
            console.log("condition of myCarObj is " + myCarObj.condition);

            console.log(formatCurrency(2.3));

            console.log("all done");
