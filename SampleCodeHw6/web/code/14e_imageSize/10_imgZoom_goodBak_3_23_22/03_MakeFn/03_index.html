        <h2>Adding a Make Function</h2>
        <ol>


            <li>
                We create a "Make" function (mine was named "MakeImgAndZoom"). This function should 
                create and return a div that is styled with class "imgAndZoom". That way, the returned 
                div will pick up the styling from the CSS file that we just created. 
                We also need to add a reference 
                from our index page to this external JS function.
            </li>

            <li>
                Our JS "Make" function needs to build the same DOM elements 
                that were in the original w3Schools example (plus the extra wrapper div and class 
                that we added). The HTML code below is what you can see in their HTML file, 
                but also adding in the extra "lens" div that they added using JavaScript. 
                You can see this extra "lens" div by inspecting the page that is rendered by their code.
            </li>
            <pre>
    &lt;div class='imgAndZoom'>
        &lt;div class="img-zoom-container">
            &lt;div class="img-zoom-lens">&lt;/div>
            &lt;img id="myimage" src="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/img_girl.jpg" width="300" height="240">
            &lt;div id="myresult" class="img-zoom-result">&lt;/div>
        &lt;/div>
    &lt;/div>       </pre>

            <li>
                We see that the Make function needs input parameters like image file name and image 
                dimensions (height and width). 
            </li>
            <li>
                Since we will add the lens div using our own JS, we can remove their JS code 
                that inserted the lens into the zoom container, before the image. 

            </li>
            <li>
                They had a function called imageZoom that took two ids (id to the image to be zoomed, 
                and id to the div that shows the magnified result). Since we are now creating these 
                two DOM elements using JavaScript, we do not need or want them to have ids. So we change 
                the input parameters to the imageZoom function so that they expect references to the two 
                elements, not ids to the two elements.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Then we have trouble because images created by JS do not have actual height and width 
                until they are placed on the page (after the Make function returns the component to the 
                Consumer Code). We can apply the solution from the previous examples which is to 
                invoke with delay (using setTimeout) any code that needs to know image sizes. 
                Since we are not overly familiar with their code just yet, we include a lot of the 
                code (into what will be called with delay) and it works !
            </li>
        </ol>
        <script>
            "use strict";
        </script>
        <script src="MakeImgAndZoom.js"></script>
        <script>
            var myImgAndZoom = MakeImgAndZoom(
                    "https://www.w3schools.com/howto/img_girl.jpg",
                    "300",
                    "240"
                    );
            document.getElementById("content").appendChild(myImgAndZoom);
        </script>
