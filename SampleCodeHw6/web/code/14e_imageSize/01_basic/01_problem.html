        <h2>Problem: Can't Tell Size of &lt;img> Until It's On The Page</h2>
        <h4>Open Chrome's Console To See Output</h4>
        <p>
            In this page, we are trying to create an &lt;img> tag using JS and then 
            we want to know the size of the image (e.g., in pixels) right away. 
            We may need to know the actual (pixel) image size for various "effects" 
            like image zoom. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem is that the size of the image (especially if being 
            set from a CSS style, possibly as a percentage) 
            will not be known until after the &lt;img> has been added to the page. 
            BUT the image is not added to the page until after our "Make" function 
            creates and returns the component with the image in it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice (from Chrome's console) that imgHeight and imgWidth are both showing 
            as 0...
        </p>

        <div id="content">

        </div>

        <script>
            "use strict";
        </script>
        <script>
            function MakeImage(imageFileName) {

                // this is an image created by javaScript
                var jsImage = document.createElement("img");
                jsImage.src = imageFileName;

                // for various things (like image zoom, etc), we need to know 
                // how big the image is (in pixels). 

                // the console will show image height and imgWidth both as 0... 
                console.log("image height is " + jsImage.height +
                        " and width is " + jsImage.width);

                return jsImage;
            } // MakeImage

            var newImage = MakeImage("pics/london_750x500.jpg");
            document.getElementById("content").appendChild(newImage);

        </script>
