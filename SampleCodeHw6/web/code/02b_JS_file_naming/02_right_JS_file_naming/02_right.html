        <p>
            This example follows our JS naming convention (every JS file has a single function inside, 
            and that function is named the same as the file that holds it). At least with this version, 
            you can easily find the JS function you are looking for.

        <script src="js/validateDecimal.js"></script>
        <script src="js/validateInteger.js"></script>
        <script>
            validateDate();
            validateInteger();
            validateDecimal();
