            <p>
                This achieves User Interface reuse but without routing. Instead of having an 
                "href" attribute, the links in the nav bar have an onclick function that 
                invokes the correct JavaScript component (function) to inject the right content. 

                Note that we are following our strict naming convention that every JS file 
                is named for the single function (or single object) defined in that file. 
                Each of these two functions, just specifies some HTML code, then "injects" 
                that code into the content area, in this example, the div with id "view". 
            </p>
            <p>
                The downside to this simple approach is that you never see any changes in the URL and 
                the user cannot use the browser's navigation buttons (forward/back). 
            </p>
        </div>

        <br/>

        <!-- THE NAV BAR -->
        <a onclick = "inject(home())">Home</a> |
        <a onclick = "inject(blog())">Blog</a> 
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <!-- Note: the JavaScript code expects there to be a DOM object with id "view" -->
        <!-- This is where the content is placed. -->
        <div id="view">

        </div>

        <script src="js/components/home.js"></script>
        <script src="js/components/blog.js"></script>

        <script>

            "use strict";

            // cleans out the container and then injects (into container) whatever was passed in.
            // if you don't clean out first, it appends, not replaces.
            function inject(what) {
                document.getElementById("view").innerHTML = "";
                document.getElementById("view").appendChild(what);
            }

            // sends the output of the call to home() to the inject function 
            inject(home());

        </script>
