        <ul>
            <li>
                Has no user interface (it just prints to the console log). 
            </li>
            <li>
                Makes two objects (each having only public properties and public methods). 
            </li>
            <li>
                Since the data members are public, you don't even have to use the public 
                setter functions.
            </li>
        </ul>
