        <h1>Image Zoom</h1>

        <p>Mouse over the image:</p>

        <div id="content">
        </div>


        <h2>Add Float &amp; Allow Percentage Image Width</h2>

        <p>
            Now that I have "mechanically converted" the code to be reusable, I start 
            thinking about the changes that I want to make:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I want the Consumer (HTML coder) to be able to specify a percentage width 
                for the zoomed picture (in the style sheet). This will enable the Consumer 
                to have a fluid layout that works well on any sized viewport. I want things 
                to continue to work properly even after resizing the browser.
                To get the resizing to work properly, you just have to add code like this: 
                <pre>
    // After the component is on the page, do whatever needs to know about image size.  
    setTimeout(setSizes, 200);
    
    // Then if the window is resized, call that same code again
    window.addEventListener('resize', setSizes);                    </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                I want the zoomed result to be side by side with the zoom picture. 

                <p>
                    Originally, I used a flexbox (flex direction row) to hold the zoom image 
                    and the zoom result. This worked fine when increasing the width of the browser.   
                    However, when decreasing the browser's width, the image height would not 
                    reduce (changing the image's aspect ratio, making the image tall and skinny). 
                    So, I used float (instead of flexbox) to get things side by side. Everything
                    works great now. Remember that, when using float, that you need to put a "clear:both" div 
                    at the bottom of your component - to prevent elements below your component from 
                    floating up into your component. 
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
