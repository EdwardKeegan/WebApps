            ES6 Backtick - a third type of quote.
        </h3>
        <p>
            When using JavaScript to create HTML, a lot of quotes are involved. 
            You can use single quotes ' and/or double quotes ", but sometimes
            you may need three levels of quotes (quotes inside of quotes 
            inside of quotes). That's where the backtick can come in handy.
            AND with a backtick, you can define multi-line String literals. 
            This is very nice when defining a large block of HTML code as a 
            JavaScript String literal.

            Here's the code.
        </p>
        <pre>                                            
    var message = `
        &lt;h1 id="welcome">Welcome&lt;/h1>
        &lt;p>We love having you here&lt;/p>
    `;
    document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = message;
        </pre>

        <p>
            Here's the output produced by the code.
        </p>

        <div id="output" style='margin-left:3em'>TODO write content</div>
        <script>
            /* We can use the back tick (upper left of your keyboard) to 
             * help us build multiline strings and this is a good way to 
             * work with HTML code that often already has single and double 
             * quotes in it.                                                  */
            var message = `
                <h1 id="welcome">Welcome</h1>
                <p>We love having you here</p>
            `;
            document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = message;
