               you'll see a horizontal because the footer becomes a little wider than 100%                            */

                    This version demonstrates multiple columns in the content area and is responsive. 
                    Narrow the browser and note how the multi-columns convert to 
                    single columns when in mobile mode. The multiple columns are implemented using flex box, 
                    like we did to get the title and nav to be in the same row. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The styles for the multiple columns have been placed in a separate style sheet to maximize reusability. 
                    We specifically excluded any styles that would not be reusable 
                    (e.g., color choices). This very short style sheet accomplishes a lot of what "Bootstrap" provides
                    regarding responsive multiple columns and responsive images. Bootstrap is a CSS Responsive Design 
                    Framework.

                    <strong>London</strong> is the capital and largest city of both England and the United Kingdom.
                    Standing on the River Thames in the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile 
                    (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. 
                    Londinium was founded by the Romans. The City of London (colloquially known as the Square Mile) 
                    retains boundaries that follow closely its medieval limits.

                    41 square miles and an official estimated population of over two million 
                    residents (as of 2019). Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's

                    <strong>Tokyo</strong> has served as the Japanese 
                    capital since 1869. As of 2018, the Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous 
                    metropolitan area in the world. Tokyo was formerly named Edo in 1603 
                    by Shogun Tokugawa - it was renamed Tokyo
                    in 1868 by emperor Meiji. Tokyo is often referred to as a city but it is officially 
                    a "metropolitan prefecture", which combines the elements of a city 
                    and a prefecture, a characteristic unique to Tokyo.
