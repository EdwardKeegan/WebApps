            <ul>
                <li>
                    In this layout, the nav bar div aligns right underneath the title div that's aligned left. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Just for debugging (and educational reasons), I have added "border:thin solid red" to the #title 
                    rule set and to the #nav rule set. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If you have a "regular div" (meaning default 
                            static positioning), the width of any div seems to be 100% (wider than its contents dictate). 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The body background color (black) "shows through" the titleNav and footer. The content 
                    has a contrasting background color.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- unordered (bulleted) list, li means "list item" -->
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Text</strong>: Make sure that all text (including link tags &lt;a>) is 
                    <strong><em style="margin-right:0.5ex;">ALWAYS</em></strong> 
                    easy to read. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Make the text have enough <strong>contrast</strong> with its background. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make the text <strong>large</strong> enough.  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use line-height for spacing between lines.
                            You can also use letter-spacing for a stylized look within an important word.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use padding and/or margin to prevent text from being too close to 
                            any visible edge. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Use "rem"</strong> for measuring font-sizes and <strong>vertical spacing</strong> (like 
                            padding/margin top/bottom). 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    "rem" is a newer measurement unit that means the normal font-size of the root element of the viewport. It 
                                    scales well (desktop/mobile). 
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fluid Layout (width)</strong>: narrow the browser to test the layout at different widths. It should 
                    always wrap nicely filling out all the horizontal space (no wasted space, no horizontal scroll bar).
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Use percentage</strong> for specifying widths and <strong>horizontal spacing</strong> 
                            (like padding/margin left/right). 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Remember that with "box-sizing:border-box" (which is recommended), div widths include border and padding 
                                    but not margin. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Use math to allocate the 100% width.     
                                </li>
                            </ul>      
                        </li>


                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Don't mix measurement units</strong> (e.g., pixels and rem) on any dimension 
                    (e.g., width or height) since this can cause alignment problems on different 
                    sizes of viewports.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Vertical Layout</strong>: make sure your page would look good with a lot of content and with a little 
                    content. We will be writing single page applications and the content will change depending on 
                    what the user clicks on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Code Indentation</strong>: always indent your code while programming 
                    indented using Alt-Shift-F or 
                    "Source - Format" from the NetBeans menu.
