               padding is not added to the width. For example, if you make the footer 100% and it has some padding, 
               you'll see a horizontal because the footer becomes a little wider than 100%                            */

            First line of content (not hidden under TitleNav)<br/>

            <p>
                This version has a media query that makes the web page "responsive" meaning that it 
                looks good regardless of the width of the viewport, be it desktop or mobile device. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Narrow your browser window until you see a change in the layout. The nav bar should 
                go under the title and the top margin of the content area gets taller so that the 
                top of the content is not hidden under the taller titleNav. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Although you may find examples that use pixels as the unit of measurement 
                for the media query min-width, I recommend that you use "rem" instead 
                (and I looked into it from 
                <a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/media-query-units/#:~:text=Since%20all%20three%20media%20queries,rem%20queries%20at%20this%20stage.">here</a>).
            </p>
            <pre>
   @media only screen and (min-width: 40rem) { 

       /* ... */

   }            </pre>

            Since you have specified your title and nav bar link text using rem measurements, 
            specifying the media query min-width also with rem will provide consistent results 
            when you narrow your browser. When narrowing your browser, your nav bar should 
            move down to the next line about when your title would overlap with your nav bar.
