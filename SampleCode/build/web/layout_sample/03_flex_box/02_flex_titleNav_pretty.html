               you'll see a horizontal because the footer becomes a little wider than 100%                            */

            <p>
                Normally the default behavior of divs (like all HTML block elements) is to start and end on a new line, 
                as you saw in the case of the title and the nav divs in the previous example. 
                We can change this behavior by using the new CSS flex-box. 
                We get the title and nav divs to be in the same "row" by setting their container (titleNav) to 
                <strong>display:flex</strong> 
                and <strong>flex-direction:row</strong>. To make the title left justified and 
                the nav right justified, we use <strong>justify-content:space-between</strong> (all rules for titleNav).
            </p>           
            <p>
                This is a better usage of the space on the page, less waste vertically for the titleNav.
            </p>
            <p>
                Change your browser width, making it narrower and narrower. 
                Note that the title never wraps and neither does the nav bar (which is good), but when the width 
                gets too narrow, the only way to access to the right nav links is to use the horizontal scroll bar 
                (which no one likes). One of the next examples will address this problem by using a Media Query (stay tuned...).
            </p>
