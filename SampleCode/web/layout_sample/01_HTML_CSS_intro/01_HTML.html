        <h1>Your First HTML Page</h1>
        <p>
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Right click this page, select "View Source", and you'll 
            see what HTML looks like. HTML has a finite list of about 50 elements, most of which 
            have a starting tag and an end tag. For example, a "p" tag represents a paragraph and looks like this: 
            &lt;p> ...the text of the paragraph ... &lt;/p>. There are also HTML tags for images, bullet items, tables, and more.
        </p>

        <h3>Head Element</h3>
        <p>
            In the head element you place information for the browser, things like: 
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>
                the page <strong>title</strong> (shows up in the tab of your browser),
            </li>
            <li>
                a <strong>character set</strong> specification (tells the browser 
                which character set you'll use -- UTF-8 instead of ASCII or ANSI),
            </li>
            <li>
                a <strong>viewport</strong> specification 
                (helpful when designing web pages that look good on desktop as well as mobile viewports), and 
            </li>
            <li>
                a <strong>&lt;style></strong> element inside which you can specify style rules to make our page
                look better than just black/white. 
            </li>
        </ul>   
        <h3>Body Element</h3>
        <p>
            In the body element, you put the HTML elements that will be seen in the browser window.
            The body element of this page (right click and View Source) has examples of these HTML tags: 
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>
                "<strong>h1</strong>" tag, "h2" tag, "h3" tags (different levels of headings),
            </li>
            <li>
                "<strong>p</strong>" tags (paragraphs), 
            </li>
            <li>
                "<strong>ul</strong>" and "li" tags (bullet items: ul stands for unordered list, li stands for list item), 
            </li>
            <li>
                "<strong>strong</strong>" tags (define where to start/stop bolding), and
            </li>
            <li>
                "<strong>a</strong>" tags (stands for anchor, lets you link):
            </li>
            <li>
                "<strong>img</strong>" (image) and 
                "<strong>video</strong>" are both shown in the next section - they are too big (visually) to put right here. 
            </li>
            <li>
                We will learn about HTML <strong>tables</strong> and HTML <strong>inputs</strong> in future homework modules.
            </li>
            <li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Images</h4>
        <p>
            Without styling, image and video tags are treated like a really large character (generally not 
            desirable). We'll soon learn how to use CSS to style them nicely, but for now, here's how they 
            show up with no styling. First, an image: <img src="pet.png"/>. Note that this image uses 
            the color "transparent" around the edges, but as far as the browser is concerned, it is a square 
            image. 
        </p>

        <h4>Video</h4>
        <p>
            Next, here is an video tag
            <video width="600" controls>
                <source src="welcomeZoom_2min.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video> 
            right in the middle of a sentence.
        </p>

    </body>
