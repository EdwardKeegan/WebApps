                    <strong>London</strong> is the capital and largest city of both England and the United Kingdom.
                    Standing on the River Thames in the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile 
                    (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. 
                    Londinium was founded by the Romans. The City of London (colloquially known as the Square Mile) 
                    retains boundaries that follow closely its medieval limits.

                    <strong>Tokyo</strong> has served as the Japanese 
                    capital since 1869. As of 2018, the Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous 
                    metropolitan area in the world. Tokyo was formerly named Edo in 1603 
                    by Shogun Tokugawa - it was renamed Tokyo
                    in 1868 by emperor Meiji. Tokyo is often referred to as a city but it is officially 
                    a "metropolitan prefecture", which combines the elements of a city 
                    and a prefecture, a characteristic unique to Tokyo.
