            <p>
                Once you are happy with your layout, it's advisable that you move your styles to an <strong>external style sheet</strong> because you are separating concerns 
                (content stays in the HTML page, style goes to the external CSS style sheet). 
                This makes the HTML page a lot shorter and easier to edit.
            </p>           
            <p>
                Please note, however, that once you put your styles into an external style sheet, it is possible 
                (likely?) that your old style sheet may be cached by the browser and you may not see your latest 
                style changes when you refresh your page. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To check if you are using the latest version of your style sheet, you can right click the page (in the browser), 
                    View Source, then click on the style sheet reference in the &lt;link> tag. This will show you the style 
                    sheet that the browser is using. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make sure you are using the latest version of your style sheet, you can try holding down the 
                    control key when you refresh the page, or re-run the page from NetBeans, or empty out 
                    your browser's cache, or run an "incognito window", or disable caching using Chrome developer tools 
                    (F12 - click on Network - click on Disable Cache, but this only works if you have the F12 open). 
                </li>
