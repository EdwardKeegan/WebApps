                The web site will provide contact details to clients for myself and the brokerage, as
                well as current market listings.<br> These listings will be made into a database that will organize them 
                with criteria. Some of these fields include:</p> <ul>
                <li>Purchase price</li>
                <li>Address</li>
                <li>Beds/Baths</li>
            </ul>

                I have very little web design experience, I hope to develop more skills as this course progresses.<br>
                I have taken an outside course at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a><br>
                It was a nice intro to HTML. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I found the external style sheet to be fairly straight forward, pulling the css code out from the index <br>
                into it's own style sheet and then linking it back to the index was easy. I belive things will become <br>
                more complicated as we progress into using Javascript.
